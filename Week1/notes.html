        <h1>My Notes</h1>

        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How often is local storage necessary?</li>
            <li>Do users find this helpful or a hindurance?</li>
            <li>How much bandwidth would this take to load or save the file?</li>
            <li>What applications would this be useful in?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mobile First Design</h3>
        <ul>
           <li> Why does it make it easier to design when you design with mobile first in 
               mind?  What makes it more simple and more beautiful?</li>

            <li>It’s important to design for mobile first because after 30 years of designing
                 for large screens only (Think computers) we have seen a massive paradigm shift 
                 to small devices such as smart phones and tablets.</li>

            <li>One reason this shift may have happened is everyone being able to have their
                 “own” computer and the turn over is quite fast compared to a desktop 
                 computer.</li>

            <li>Another important point of designing for mobile first is that the web is 
                explore now more than 20% more on mobile devices rather than desktops.</li>

            <li>Responsive retrofitting is not the same as mobile first.  It still has issues 
                with screen real estate and touch interaction. </li>

            <li>Mobile first also addresses the constraints of mobile size and bandwidth.
                  They are also more future friendly and ready for growth.</li>

            <li>Make sure to start small and then scale up.</li>

            <li>You have to see what people are doing and needing and then make a solution. 
                 You can’t ask them what solution they would like.  You have to give them
                  a simple solution to their problem.</li>

            <li>Interactions should be smooth, seamless, and intuitive.  Try to make the
                 user not even notice it.  “It only takes a second…” can be a second too 
                 long and cause abandonment of the product.</li>

            <li>When thinking of mobile first design we also need to think about how people
                 will hold their device when accessing the design.  You want important 
                 things easily tapped without having to change hand placement or readjust
                  to get used to etc.</li>

            <li>The faster it loads the longer the user will stick around and experience the
                 design.</li>

            <li>Reduce image usage in mobile apps and sites. If images are necessary SVGs
                 or webfonts should be used.</li>

            <li>Optimize and minify CSS and JS (remove unused bits of codes and or tags,
                 also minify by removing the whitespace resulting in saving 5 -10k savings) 
                Also GZIP to remove any unnecessary data from the files.</li>

            <li>Sometimes simple fixes can make the biggest impact.  Ie moving the menu bar 
                from the top of a mobile device display to the bottom for easier usability.</li>

            <li>We have to keep evolving with the technology.  Like the hamburger button.
                  If we change to simply making a “Menu” button it receives approximately
                   20% more clicks. (Think about the end user, not the techie developing
                    or designing the product)</li>

            <li>Masking passwords doesn’t really help with security.  Hardly anyone is going
                 to be “shoulder surfing” save in very busy places where chances are you
                  aren’t going to be trying to access something that is password sensitive
                   anyways.</li>

            <li>Make sure you are coding with the correct input type. Make forms user friendly.</li>

            <li>On mobile sites you can use anchor tags to make your phone number into a link
                 the user can simply tap on to call.</li>

            <li>If you need to place ads they should be small and simple, and not take up 
                anywhere near 40% of your screen real estate</li>

            <li>DO NOT  use pop ups or pop overs, and remember users are not visiting your 
                site to view ads.</li>

        </ul>
