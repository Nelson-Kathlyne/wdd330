        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Other than a mathematical situation such as finding factors, when would a recursive function be used?</li>
            <li>When would a callback be better than a promise? And visa versa?</li>
            <li>What would be a practical application for currying?</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Other Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All functions have a length property.  This property says how many parameters can be passed</li>
            <li>An IIFE (immediately executed function) can be used around your code to set your code to strict when possibly 
                doing team work and not knowing if someone else’s code is set to strict or not.</li>
            <li>A function can redefine and even rewrite itself.  However, we must be careful when doing this because previously 
                assigned properties could be lost</li>
            <li>We can define a function based on what methods are supported.</li>
            <li>Recursive functions are functions that will continue to invoke itself until a certain condition is met.</li>
            <li>Promises can be used in place of callbacks.  They are said to be pending until all code leading to the promise is complete.  
                In this state the promise is said to be unsettled. Once the operation is completed it is said to be settled.  A settled promise is 
                either:
               <br> a.	Resolved – the asynchronous operation was completed successfully
               <br> b.	Rejected – The asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn’t successfully completed, resulting in an error.
            </li>
            <li>Asynchronous functions can be created by preceding them with async.  The callback / promise / asynchronous function is preceded
                 by the keyword await.</li>
            <li>When using an asynchronous function the steps of the function should be wrapped in a try block in order to catch any errors that might be thrown.  
                <br>Each step can be written in order, and the await is used to ensure the next line of code is not ran until that part is completed (receiving a value 
                <br>from another function).</li>
            <li>When using a generator function * is placed after function and before the name of the function.  Yield is then used where return is generally used.</li>
            <li>By using “pure functions” we are more able to create building blocks to more complex functions.  This modularizes them and makes them more usable and easily 
                understandable.</li>
            <li>Higher order functions will accept another function as an argument or return another function.</li>
            <li>A function has been curried when not all arguments have been supplied to the function.</li>
            <li>All curried functions are high order functions because they return a function, however not all high order functions are curried.</li>
            <li>A curried function allows for a more general function to be specialized to a particular situation:
                   <br>Ex: function multiplier(x,y) {
                   <br>  if (y === undefined) {
                   <br>     return function(z) {
                   <br>     return x * z;
                   <br>    }
                   <br> } else {
                   <br>    return x * y;
                   <br> }
                   <br>}
                   <br> calcTax = multiplier(0.22);
                   <br> function (z){
                   <br> return x * z;
                   <br>}
                   <br>calcTax(400);
                   <br>88
                </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>AJAX</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>AJAX allows for new web content to be updated without completely refreshing the page.</li>
            <li>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.</li>
            <li>JSON is now used more frequently than XML and is native to JavaScript (though the process it uses it still known as AJAX)</li>
            <li>At this time the redirect() method is not supported in any browsers.</li>
        </ul>
